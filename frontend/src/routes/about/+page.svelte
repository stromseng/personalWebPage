                I'm a 22 year old Informatics student from Oslo, Norway. I'm
                currently in the first year of my master's degree at the
                Norwegian University of Technology and Science. I'm passionate
                about technology and I love to learn new things. I'm also a big
                fan of open source software and I try to contribute to open
                source projects whenever I can.
